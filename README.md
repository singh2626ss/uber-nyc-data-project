# uber-nyc-data-project
This end-to-end analytics project showcases a scalable data pipeline built on  Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using:  - Cloud Storage for raw CSV ingestion -  Mage AI  on  Compute Engine for ETL orchestration - BigQuery for analytics-ready warehouse design - Looker Studio for interactive BI dashboarding 

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Google Cloud Storage** – raw data ingestion
- **Mage AI (ETL)** – transformation & orchestration
- **Google Compute Engine** – ETL execution environment
- **BigQuery** – data warehousing & analytics
- **Looker Studio** – business intelligence visualization
- **Python & SQL** – automation, querying, and pipeline logic

## 🧠 Key Analytics & Metrics

The final analytics layer joins fact and dimension tables for BI-ready insights. Some metrics visualized:

- Total Revenue, Gross Margin, and Total Trips
- Average Fare per Trip and Tip %
- Trip Volume by Distance Range
- Avg Fare & Tip by Passenger Count
- Revenue Breakdown by Payment Method & Rate Code
- Credit Card Usage % (Gauge Chart)
- Rate Code to Payment Flow (Sankey Chart)
- Pickup Location Heatmap (Google Maps)
